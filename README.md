# Leetcode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Leetcode problems.  
Each problem is solved in a separate file, with clear code and comments where necessary.

## ðŸ“š Structure

- Each file is named after the problem (e.g., `two_sum.js`, `reverse_linked_list.py`).
- Solutions are written in JS, but other programming language can be used depending on the problem and my learning goals.
- Each commit typically adds a new problem solution.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

- To track my progress as I practice coding and problem-solving.
- To serve as a reference for myself and others preparing for coding interviews.
- To improve my skills in algorithms, data structures, and clean code.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

This repository uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing JavaScript solutions.

### How to run tests

1. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Run all tests:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
3. Run tests for a specific problem:
   ```sh
   npx jest problem_name.test.js
   ```
   Replace `problem_name.test.js` with the test file you want to run.
