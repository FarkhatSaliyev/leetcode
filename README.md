# Leetcode Solutions
This repository contains my personal solutions to various Leetcode problems.
Each problem is solved in a separate file, with clear code and comments where necessary.

📚 Structure
Each file is named after the problem (e.g., two_sum.js, reverse_linked_list.py).
Solutions are written mostly in JS programming language, but other programming language can be used depending on the problem and my learning goals.
Each commit typically adds a new problem solution.

🚀 Purpose
To track my progress as I practice coding and problem-solving.
To serve as a reference for myself and others preparing for coding interviews.
To improve my skills in algorithms, data structures, and clean code.

📝 Usage
